# robloxafkdetector
A tool that warns you when you are about to be AFK-kicked on roblox.
Use CTRL+ALT+Q to exit the program.

Detects when the RobloxPlayerBeta.exe (configurable) process hasn't received any input for a selected time period, and plays a noise aswell as displaying a pop-up. 
Useful for afk-ing certain games that dont have an anti-afk measure in place.

This was made in AutoHotkey in literally 10 minutes with the help of ChatGPT, its not amazing, but it does the job.

INSTALLATION:

Just download the .exe from releases and run it, it will let you know when you're about to be kicked.
