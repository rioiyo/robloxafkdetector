# robloxafkdetector
A tool that warns you when you are about to be AFK-kicked on roblox.
Use CTRL+ALT+Q to exit the program.

Detects when the RobloxPlayerBeta.exe (configurable) process hasn't received any input for a selected time period, and plays a noise aswell as displaying a pop-up. 
Useful for afk-ing certain games that dont have an anti-afk measure in place.

This was made in AutoHotkey in literally 10 minutes with the help of ChatGPT, its not amazing, but it does the job.

INSTALLATION:

Just download the .exe from releases and run it, input the .exe name (leave blank for roblox) (find the .exe by right clicking the program in task manager and going to properties), the tool will notify you when you're about to be kicked.
